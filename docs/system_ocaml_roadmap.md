# SystemOCaml: Roadmap for Systems Programming Extensions

## Phase 1: PPX Proof of Concept (1-2 months)
**No fork needed - Works with standard OCaml**

```ocaml
(* stack_alloc.ppx *)
let process_packet data =
  let%stack buffer = Bytes.create 1500 in
  (* PPX transforms to: *)
  (* let buffer = allocate_on_stack 1500 in *)
  process buffer data

(* inline_asm.ppx *)  
let read_timestamp () =
  [%asm "rdtsc" (output: "=A" (result: int64))]
  (* PPX generates C stub automatically *)
```

### Implementation:
1. Create PPX rewriters for each feature
2. Generate C stubs where needed
3. Package as opam library
4. Test with real systems code

## Phase 2: Compiler Fork (3-6 months)
**If PPX isn't enough, create SystemOCaml**

### Repository Structure:
```
SystemOCaml/
├── upstream/      # Track upstream OCaml
├── system/        # Your extensions
│   ├── stack_alloc.ml
│   ├── inline_asm.ml
│   ├── layout_control.ml
│   └── no_runtime.ml
├── tests/
└── docs/
```

### Key Changes:

#### 1. Stack Allocation
```diff
(* typing/typecore.ml *)
+ | Pexp_stack expr ->
+     let ty = newvar() in
+     let expr' = type_expr env expr in
+     { exp_desc = Texp_stack expr';
+       exp_type = ty;
+       exp_attributes = [Stack_allocated] }
```

#### 2. Inline Assembly  
```diff
(* parsing/parser.mly *)
+ | ASM LPAREN string_literal constraints RPAREN
+     { mkexp (Pexp_asm($3, $4)) }

(* asmcomp/amd64/emit.mlp *)
+ | Lasm(template, constraints) ->
+     emit_inline_asm template constraints
```

#### 3. Memory Layout Control
```diff
(* typing/typedecl.ml *)
+ | "repr", [Repr_C | Repr_packed | Repr_aligned n] ->
+     set_memory_layout decl layout_spec
```

#### 4. No Runtime Mode
```diff
(* asmcomp/asmlink.ml *)
+ if !Clflags.no_runtime then
+   link_no_runtime ppf objects target
+ else
+   link_normal ppf objects target
```

## Phase 3: Community Building (Ongoing)

### Name Options:
1. **SystemOCaml** - Clear purpose
2. **OCaml-RT** - Real-Time OCaml
3. **BareOCaml** - Bare metal focus
4. **OCaml-S** - S for Systems
5. **MetalML** - Metal + ML

### Distribution:
```bash
# As a separate compiler
opam switch create system-ocaml https://github.com/you/system-ocaml

# Or as compiler variant
opam switch create 5.2.0+system
```

### Compatibility Strategy:
```ocaml
(* Regular OCaml code works unchanged *)
let normal_function x = x + 1

(* System features are opt-in *)
[@@@system_extensions]
let%stack fast_function x =
  let%asm timestamp = "rdtsc" in
  process_with_timestamp x timestamp
```

## Phase 4: Upstream Contribution (Long term)

### Prepare RFCs for OCaml core:
1. **OCaml-RFC-001**: Stack allocation annotations
2. **OCaml-RFC-002**: Inline assembly support  
3. **OCaml-RFC-003**: Compile-time layout control
4. **OCaml-RFC-004**: No-runtime compilation mode

### Success Stories Needed:
- Port a device driver to SystemOCaml
- Write a microkernel
- Create an embedded RTOS
- Build a high-frequency trading system

## Why This Could Succeed

### Similar Success Stories:
- **ReasonML** - Alternative syntax for OCaml
- **BuckleScript/ReScript** - OCaml to JavaScript
- **js_of_ocaml** - OCaml to JavaScript (different approach)
- **MirageOS** - Pushed OCaml toward systems programming

### Your Unique Value:
- **Focus**: Systems programming specifically
- **Pragmatic**: Add only what's needed
- **Compatible**: Regular OCaml still works
- **Proven need**: MirageOS already wants this

## Technical Details

### Compiler Architecture:
```
Source (.ml) 
    ↓
Parser (+ your AST nodes)
    ↓
Type Checker (+ stack/layout annotations)
    ↓
Lambda (+ your primitives)
    ↓
CMM (+ inline asm)
    ↓
Assembly (+ direct emissions)
    ↓
Native Code
```

### Testing Strategy:
```ocaml
(* Test suite *)
let test_stack_allocation () =
  let%stack buf = Bytes.create 1_000_000 in
  (* Should not increase heap size *)
  let before = Gc.heap_words() in
  let%stack buf2 = Bytes.create 1_000_000 in
  let after = Gc.heap_words() in
  assert (after = before)

let test_inline_asm () =
  let%asm (lo, hi) = "rdtsc" in
  assert (hi >= 0L && lo >= 0L)
```

## Decision Framework

### Stay with PPX if:
- 80% of features achievable
- Standard OCaml compatibility important
- Don't want maintenance burden

### Fork if:
- Need deep runtime changes
- Want maximum performance
- Building specific system (OS, embedded)
- Have time to maintain

### Contribute upstream if:
- Changes benefit everyone
- Have patience (years)
- Want official support

## Conclusion

Creating SystemOCaml would make you the "Graydon Hoare of OCaml" (Rust's creator). It's ambitious but achievable. Start with PPX to prove concepts, fork if needed, and maybe one day merge upstream.

The systems programming world needs a language that combines safety, performance, and verification. SystemOCaml could be it!
