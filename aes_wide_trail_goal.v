(*
 * AES Wide Trail Strategy Theorem - 25 Active Bytes
 * This theorem proves the fundamental security property of AES
 *)

Require Import Nat List.

(* Definition: Active bytes in a state *)
Definition active_bytes (s : list nat) : nat := 
  length (filter (fun b => negb (Nat.eqb b 0)) s).

(* GOAL: Prove that after 4 rounds, any trail has at least 25 active bytes *)
Theorem four_round_minimum_active_bytes : forall (s0 s4 : list nat),
  (* After 4 rounds of AES transformations *)
  active_bytes s4 >= 25.
Proof.
  (* AutoProver will generate the real proof here *)
